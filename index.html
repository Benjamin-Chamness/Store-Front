            <p>Snare drums are usually played with drum sticks, but other beaters such as the brush or the rute can be used
               to achieve different tones. The snare drum is a versatile and expressive percussion instrument due to its 
               sensitivity and responsiveness.

                <img src="img/tamb.jpg"/>
                <p>Classically the term tambourine denotes an instrument with a drumhead, though some variants may not have a 
                   head at all. Tambourines are often used with regular percussion sets. They can be mounted, for example on 
                   a stand as part of a drum kit (and played with drum sticks), or they can be held in the hand and played by 
                   tapping or hitting the instrument.</p>
